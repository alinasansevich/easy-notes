# easy-notes
A sticky notes web app built with Django.
---

The goal of this project is to allow users to take notes, write down thoughts and/or create reminders, and stick them to their online wall. Users will be able to
give a title to their notes, write them as simple text or add a bullet list. It will keep all notes listed so the user can quickly see the contents of the note and
find the one they want.

Keep all your notes organized in one virtual board, take them with you, and enjoy your day!
